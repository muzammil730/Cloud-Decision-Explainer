The Scope of the Project:
Cloud Decision Explainer (CDE)

Scope/Services: 
   EC2
   ECS (Fargate)
   Lambda 

Starting with small scope can lead to more success. later on more services can be added. 

Decision Factors: --> Decision factors used to evaluate and compare cloud compute services

Traffic Pattern: Expected request behavior such as low, steady, or bursty traffic.

Cost Sensitivity: How critical cost control is for the application.

Scalability Requirement: Ability of the service to handle growth without redesign.

Operational Overhead: Effort required to manage infrastructure and operations.

Control / Customization: Level of control needed over runtime and environment.

Latency Sensitivity: Impact of response time on user experience. 

Weights:

 Parameter         Weight   Logic
Traffic Pattern     0.25    Traffic pattern has the highest weight because it directly impacts cost efficiency, scaling behavior, and failure risk.
Cost Sensitivity    0.20    Cost sensitivity is critical because poor cost decisions can make cloud solutions unsustainable, especially for early-stage projects.
Scalability         0.20    Scalability represents the core promise of cloud computing. If a service cannot scale effectively, moving to the cloud provides limited value.
Ops Overhead        0.15    Most teams do not have dedicated DevOps resources. Services with lower operational overhead reduce management complexity and long-term risk.
Control             0.10    Deep infrastructure control is required only for specific workloads. For most applications, standard managed environments are sufficient.
Latency             0.10    Latency is important but not a primary constraint for most non-real-time applications such as standard web or backend systems.
